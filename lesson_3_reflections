When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local

    When coloborating with other people, who lets say aren't in the same building that are or in the same network, 
    or when I work on the same project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I'm not sure that the changes will work, they shouldn't be pulled unless they are tested and work properly, 
    since there might be other people working on the project and these changes can make trouble for them also.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a copy of someones repository into our accounts (github servers but associated with our account).
    Clones are creating a new copy of a specific repository into our computer locally.
    Branches may be considered as leafs from the main tree (master branch) were you can make different changes without affecting the main tree, any you can make branhces on forks or clones.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's good to know what's the difference between your changes (dou did localy) and the ones that were synced lastly with the remote one.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Well to be honest I don't have a clear idea how, but probably by creating copies for different of the project for all the collaborators. 
    It's impossible to think what would be easier right now that I got the Git & GitHub concepts, but harder would be everything like comparing changes, checking if they work for everyone, etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
